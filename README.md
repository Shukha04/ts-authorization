# Getting Started with Authorization Example App Created With TypeScript

This project created by courses found in internet to practice such skills as Typescript, ExpressJS and ReactJS, how to
use JWT in authorization server etc. and is just a test version

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `cd client && yarn start`

Runs the client in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `cd client && yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `cd client && yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `client/build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
And app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `cd client && yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you are not satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right
into your project, so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t
customize it when you are ready for it.

### `cd server && yarn dev`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) or on port you declared in `.env` file in servers directory to run
it.

The server will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
